# lyx-templates
Document templates for LaTeX / LyX

This repository contains a collection of templates for LyX software. Templates are based on KOMA-scripts, 
and include additional configurations for fonts, colors, minimal document structures,
default settings for some programming langages (Java or Matlab), settings for french language...

## Installation

Templates are located in the "templates" directory. Each template corresponds to a LyX file. 

To install a template, it suffices to copy the corresponding LyX file into the appropriate directory:
* For LyX versions previous uo to 2.3.*, the "templates" directory is that of the current LyX installation (typical windows location: `C:\Program Files\LyX-2.3\Resources\templates`, please update to your local configuration).
* from LyX versions 2.4, it is possible to use user directory: `~\AppData\Roaming\LyX2.4\templates`

## Usage

From LyX, simply click on File -> Open With Template... and select the appropriate template. From version 2.4, it is possible to filter user templates.
